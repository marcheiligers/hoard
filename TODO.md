## Front End

## Chart
- If a company recently listed there won't be updates to the chart for every selection of the date range. Add a reducer method to pass a prop to a SnackBar to show the warning.
- remove click handler for 1 day selection.
- Add in datePicker for specific date selection -> will need datepicker? OR custom value text input?, research onClick handler for a datapoint for on-graph selection. (https://canvasjs.com/docs/charts/chart-options/data/datapoints/)

## Company errors:
Clean up error handling in Redux, resuse the same error on state, implement snackbars

## Company Info:
Convert to nicely styled cards

## Redux testing:

_Current WIP:_
