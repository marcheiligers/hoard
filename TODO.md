## Front End

## Chart Data Not Changing
If a company recently listed there won't be updates to the chart for every selection of the date range. Add a reducer method to pass a prop to a SnackBar to show the warning.

## Company errors:
Clean up error handling in Redux, resuse the same error on state, implement snackbars

## Company Info:
Convert to nicely styled cards

## Redux testing:
Add tests for new functionality

_Current WIP:_
- Add in filter for date range
- Add filter selection to chart title
