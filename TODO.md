## Front End

The filters need to be implemented.
Filters required are:

...

## Chart
- If a company recently listed there won't be updates to the chart for every selection of the date range. Add a reducer method to pass a prop to a SnackBar to show the warning.
- Add in datePicker for specific date selection -> will need datepicker? OR custom value text input?, research onClick handler for a datapoint for on-graph selection. (https://canvasjs.com/docs/charts/chart-options/data/datapoints/)

## Company errors:
Implement snackbars for general errors on Chart API calls.

## Company Info:

## Redux testing:

## Navigation
Consider adding a quick link or drop down filter to select a stock when on the single company page.
(Add the scrollable list back to nav?)

_Current WIP:_
